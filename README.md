# Frogger

This is game 3 of the 20 game challenge. All the sprites were hand drawn by me in Krita, and are all 8-bit. My plans are to do all SFX and music myself as well using Ableton and/or Audacity. When this is all done, I may or may not have a YouTube video showing the process of me making this game. The code in this will be MIT license, and all the assets I made will be CC0, and available for the public domain. I do not intend to do this to make money. This is simply for educational purposes only.
